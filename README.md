# Voron-2.4r2T
350X x 350Y x 950Z Voron 2.4r2 Tall
# Why Build this Monster?
We like to print a lot of tall objects -- boat hulls, display models etc. and instead of printing them multiple 350mm tall pieces, I wanted to build a printer that could do this in one or two pieces.
# Design Objectives
- Make a printer that reuses most, if not all of the standard Voron parts, but is as tall as possible.
# Design Choices
- 1000mm MGN9 rails were easy to get, so I used those for the Z rails.
- A 350X x 350Y Voron design will be used as parts are readily available including built plates, heaters, gantry rails, etc.
- Coroplast will be used on the back and bottom -- laser cut to size.
- 4040 rails will be used on the entire frame.
# Coverting from an Existing Voron 2.4
- If you have a Voron 2.4, upgrade to all the 2.4r2 parts while you are doing this project.
# Converting from an Existing Voron 2.4r2
- The gantry will be used, unchanged
- The gantry wiring and XY endstop pod wiring will need to be re-run because it is longer.
- You'll need a longer Z chain.
- 4040 extrusions are used on the entire frame for rigidity.
- You may want a new hot end so you can use bigger nozzles faster. I chose the Rapido.
# BOM (only the changes from a 2.4r2 are listed)
- Z chain -- I like the cheap, generic ones. [Amazon Link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08R1M9J2H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1)
